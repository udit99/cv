\opening{Dear Sir/Ma'am} 
 
\noindent I've been a NewRelic customer for a while now and have always been very impressed with your product. I am a San Francisco-based developer working with a software-consultancy (ThoughtWorks) for 5-6 years now and I'm looking for other opportunities. Between my work projects and my personal projects, I have lots of recent Ruby/Rails experience. The prospect of working for your company excites me enough to motivate to me write a Cover Letter in LaTeX. I don't remember the last cover letter I ever wrote. But I digress. 

I would like to apply for the position of Ruby on Rails Developer. But really, I like to think of myself as a software generalist with predominantly web development experience. But I digress. My resume is at udit.manektala.com. I would love to hear from you guys about this opportunity.
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
